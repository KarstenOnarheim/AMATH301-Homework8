## Part a - Define the 3x3 rotation matrix.

    return np.array([[np.cos(theta), -np.sin(theta), 0],
                     [np.sin(theta), np.cos(theta), 0],
                     [0, 0, 1]])

## Part b - Define the vector y, setup the algebraic problem, and then solve for x

y = [3, np.pi, 4]
x = scipy.linalg.solve(A1, y)

## Part c - save A
print(np.linalg.norm(AA))
print(sum(sum(AA)))
## Part d - Find the forces

## Part e - Find the largest force
# Make sure you have the order correct: we want the largest OF the absolute
# values!


## Part f - We now need to loop somehow. Once one of the forces exceeds 44000
# Newtons, the bridge collapses. It *can* be exactly 44000 Newtons without
# collapsing.
# You will need a break statement if the bridge collapses!

## Load in the image of beautiful Olive
A = cv2.imread('olive.jpg', 0) # Make sure that 'olive.jpg' is in the same
                               # folder as this file

## Part (a) - Perform SVD
U, S, Vt = np.linalg.svd(A, full_matrices=False) # Vt = V transpose

## Part (b) - Find the 15 largest singular values.
# Remember that the singular values are ranked by default!

## Part (c) - Calculate the rank-1 energy proportion
total_energy = np.sum(S)
# Now use that to get A12

## Part (d) - Calculate the proportion of energy in the rank-15 approximation

## Part (e) - Find the rank-r approximation that holds 75% of the total energy.
# Use np.where! Don't hard code this!
